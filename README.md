#Box Fashion

Box Fashion is a Bootstrap web app that I built for a client. I really enjoyed putting this one together, considering the sublte color and background changes I made to the CSS. I ran into a few roadblocks when trying to edit the hover buttons, however, I overcame all obsticles in an expeditious manner.
